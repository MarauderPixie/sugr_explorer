Reading and transformming glucose monitoring data to integrate into a shiny app.

# Overview

Medtronic gives users of their MiniMed and Guardian insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (GCM) systems 
the option to export the data collected by these systems into a large csv file. 
This project takes that data, transforms it into usable bits and makes it available for exploration in a shiny app.
